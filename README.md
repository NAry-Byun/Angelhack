#  üìùTheme
The importance of analyzing sustainability reporting for companies is becoming increasingly recognized. This underscores the need for innovative methods to extract, compare, and present sustainability objectives and their reported progress through advanced AI technologies.

# üåµProblem statement
 Problem Statement: 

For this quest, participants will tackle the challenge of leveraging AI (Generative AI) to revolutionize sustainability reporting analysis for companies. The goal is to create a system that extracts sustainability objective statements from public company communications and compares them against publicly available progress data. Participants will design a system to assess if companies are on track with their stated sustainability objectives, including compliance with emerging emissions standards in that geography. The focus will be on utilizing public data sources to enable a comparison framework and potentially a predictive rating for the company‚Äôs future ability to meet its sustainability goals and commitments.
